# Definitions
**Guide** - The Conversation Construction guide includes content that is written in markdown files managed in a GitHub repository, and published via the Netlify CMS. The guide will contain several types of content.  
**Building Blocks** - Building Blocks are the first type of content being created for the guide. They describe the principles or axioms of conversational apps.  
**Owners** - owners are responsible for creating and delivering the guide content. They can delegate content creation tasks but are ultimately responsible for delivering the content. Owners are determined by an informal consensus around which contributor has the expertise and bandwidth.  
**Reviewers** - reviewers of content are contributors assigned to review a topic based on expertise and bandwidth.  

# Building Blocks
The building blocks are grouped by the following topics based on the conversation design and development process:
* Strategy and Research
* Design and Specification
* User and Usability Testing
* Development and QA
* Modeling and Training

# How To Add Content
## How to Create a Building Block (Google Docs Process)
* Create a new document for the building block in the building blocks folder with the name of the building block. 
* The topic owner creates the first draft of the content and alerts the reviewer when theyâ€™re finished. 
* The reviewer then reviews the initial content and adds any other missing information. 
* The reviewer sends it back to the owner for review. 
* The owner can send it back for more reviews at their discretion, but ultimately decides when the document is complete. 

## How to Create a Building Block (GitHub Process)
