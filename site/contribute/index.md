Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Conversational Collective's Conversation Construction Guide! This guide will walk you through the process of making a contribution.

# How to Edit Existing Content
At the bottom of every page in the guide, you'll find a link in the footer that reads "Edit this page in GitHub." [GitHub](https://github.com) is a platform for sharing Open Source code. We use GitHub to effectively collaborate on both the code for this website and the text of its pages.

If you aren't familiar with git or GitHub, don't worry! The process to submit a change to the text is simple.

To submit a change to any page on this website, follow these steps:
  
1. If you haven't already, begin by [creating a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
2. Click the "Edit this page in GitHub" link in the footer on the page you wish to edit. (You can even use the link on this page. Give it a shot!)
3. If you haven't already, you'll see a message telling you to fork the repository. This will create your own copy of the guide in your GitHub account. Click the green "Fork this repository" button.
4. In the new page that opens, you'll see a text editor with the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) source code of the page. (Don't let the phrase "source code" intimidate you. It's mostly English prose with a very simple formatting syntax. It's actually easier to use than HTML!) Use the text editor to make your suggested change to the page.
5. At the bottom of the page, you'll see a header "Propose changes." In the text field(s) underneath this header, describe your proposed change.
6. Click the green "Propose changes" button.

This will open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) against the main repository for the Conversation Construction guide. We'll use this pull request to communicate with you about your proposed change and eventually incorporate it into the live version of the website.

# Definitions
**Guide** - The Conversation Construction guide includes content that is written in markdown files managed in a GitHub repository, and published via the Netlify CMS. The guide will contain several types of content.  
**Building Blocks** - Building Blocks are the first type of content being created for the guide. They describe the principles or axioms of conversational apps.  
**Owners** - owners are responsible for creating and delivering the guide content. They can delegate content creation tasks but are ultimately responsible for delivering the content. Owners are determined by an informal consensus around which contributor has the expertise and bandwidth.  
**Reviewers** - reviewers of content are contributors assigned to review a topic based on expertise and bandwidth.

# Building Blocks
The building blocks are grouped by the following topics based on the conversation design and development process:
* Strategy and Research
* Design and Specification
* User and Usability Testing
* Development and QA
* Modeling and Training
