You may be very excited about the new conversational AI application that you are going to build. Many a team have hunkered down in internal brainstorming sessions, only to emerge with an idea that is deemed so great that no one even considers that there may be a competitor. No matter how novel you think your idea is, research on any competitors is crucial. It provides information on the competitive landscape you are entering, and it provides an understanding of the features, packaging, etc. that others are using. It helps you understand what, presumably, is core functionality (which user jobs are being solved) and it may help you understand where you can provide unique features in the market. 

There are situations where you run a competitive search and you truly feel that there is no competition. It may indeed be that you can not find anyone who is a direct competitor. However, there is always a competitor; it may be a very distant cousin to what you are doing, it may use a different channel, etc. Map out these competitors, if only so that you can share with others how distant the competition is from your proposed product.
