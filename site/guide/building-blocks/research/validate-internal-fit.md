Any time a company decides to embark on designing and developing a new product or feature, itâ€™s important to consider whether this product or feature is a good fit for the company. Is it in line with the direction the company is going? How long will it take to develop, and will the product still be in line with the company direction at the time of release? All too often, features are added to a product to cover a specific acute use case. Yet these features may or may not enrich the product or the bigger picture.

Specific to conversational AI, the role of conversational AI in the product or product suite must be considered. Is conversational AI of interest because itâ€™s new and the company wants to be part of new technology? Does it make sense as a value-adding communication channel for the user? Can it become an inherent part of the product, its definition and use? 

Building a conversational app because of FOMO often leads to failed endeavors. If there is not a good fit, then there may not be any good reason to have a conversational aspect to the product. Research helps evaluate whether conversational AI is a good place to invest.
