      The Conversation Construction Guide defines the key principles and best practices for building and managing conversational AI applications. Each principle is defined as a Building Block that business leaders and practitioners can use to assemble their conversational AI strategy.<br><br>
      The building blocks define conversational strategies across research, design, development, and maintenance and highlight differences in how builders should approach conversational AI versus established platforms like web and mobile. The Conversation Construction Guide is your blueprint to building the best voice and chat experiences for your business.
