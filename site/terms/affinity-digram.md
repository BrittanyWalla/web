Affinity diagramming is a process for organizing, displaying, and analyzing large amounts of research data. Affinity maps (or diagrams) help inform early design strategy by collecting various data-points like statistics from studies, observations, market indicators, and user quotes. This exercise often includes collaboratively organizing and discussing these insights that have been written on sticky notes and posted on a wall.
